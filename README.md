</p>

<!-- SHORT STORY INTRO -->
<p>
I build with one conviction: technology should serve people where they are. My journey started in technical support, where identifying bugs and troubleshooting complex issues became second nature. Now, I channel that precision into backend engineering and cloud-first solutions that aim to solve real human problems.
</p>

<!-- NOW / FOCUS -->
<h2>What I’m focused on right now</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Building mastery in backend engineering and cloud SaaS architecture with a ProDev mindset.</li>
  <li>Leveraging my strength in <strong>Microsoft Identity</strong> (conceptual framework, SaaS, on-prem background) to design secure, user-centric systems.</li>
  <li>Developing <strong>CareConnect</strong>, a telemedicine platform bringing healthcare to people’s homes, reducing unnecessary hospital visits, and supporting chronically ill individuals through collaboration with HMOs, providers, and health ecosystems.</li>
  <li>Continuing to share my growth and learning in backend, CLI, and cloud tools to inspire and educate through storytelling.</li>
</ul>
